# ABOUT

slick provides an alternative to `sh -n`, which is problematic for a number of minor reasons:

* `sh` is hardly ever a bare bones POSIX sh interpreter on most UNIX systems, but usually soft linked to `bash`, `ksh`, `ash`, or even stranger things. So anyone genuinely interested in vetting their `#!/bin/sh` scripts for compliance risks getting false negative scans for scripts that actually contain bashisms, kshisms, and so on. By contrast, `slick` guarantees pure POSIX parsing, so that scripts are scanned consistently regardless of the particular environment configuration.
* `sh` is difficult to obtain in Windows. Cygwin-like environments are themselves difficult to setup. Should a unix, Linux, Windows, or other system desire syntax checking, `slick` is easy to obtain by gox ports, or through the wonderfully cross-platform Go toolchain.
